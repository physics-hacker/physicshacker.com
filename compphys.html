<H1>What is computational physics?</H1>

<p>What is a computational physicist?

<p><b>Answer:</b> A computational physicist is first of all a scientist. Scientists are concerned with discovering new knowledge about the world. A computational physicist is a scientist who specializes in computational physics. That is, a person who specializes in using computers to solve complex problems in physics. Although most of us think of Einstein writing equations out on a chalkboard when we think of physics, <b>most physics problems that researchers encounter are exceedingly difficult or impossible to solve by hand!</b> This being the case, all physicists (theorists, experimentalists and everything in-between) use computational physics at some point. And some physicists specialize in using computers to solve problems -- these are the computational physicists! 

<p>Computational physics is also a kind of computational science. <b>Computational science is totally different than computer science!</b> Computer science research involves developing new programming languages, programming techniques and algorithms for any number of purposes (video streaming, 3D rendering, image processing, word searching, audio encoding, artificial intelligence...). Computational science is about using computers to learn scientific things we didn't know before, especially in complex situations. Computational scientists take the best things from computer science and apply them to the task of simulating real-world experiments or the formation of objects in the universe. 

<p>Sometimes the tools of computer science need to be improved in order to do this well. Computational physicists helped develop the unix operating system, which later became the basis of the linux operating system. <b>Computational physicists developed the C programming language and many have contributed to the development of python and its scientific libraries.</b> But for a computational physicist, the goal is never to create these tools for their own sake. The goal is always to help computers solve scientific problems better.

<p><b>There has never been a better time to be a computational physicist!</b> The computer that you are sitting at right now has more computational power than any computational physicist possessed during most of the history of science. With great power comes great responsibility. If you are interested in computational physics, contact a physics professor at a local university or college, tell them your interest, show them the programs you have created, and if they are unhelpful ask them to point you to someone who is. Don't stop until you meet someone who knows more about computational physics than you, who can tell you something you didn't know!

<p><b>Question: Help! I'm addicted to computational physics. What'll I tell my parents?</b>

<p>Tell your parents that you want to be a computational physicist, but if it doesn't work out you can easily get a software development job with all the programming skills you're learning. The unemployment rate of physicists (all of them, not just computational physicists) is much lower than the rest of the population. The absolute worst possible thing that can happen to you is a well-paying software development job.
