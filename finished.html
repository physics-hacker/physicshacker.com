<H1>Finished everything?</H1>

<p>Did you finish everything? Hungry for more? Here is some thoughts about what to do next:

<p><b>1. You've just been introduced to computational physics with a programming language that is very similar to C</b>

<p>The simplest thing to do is to continue studying computational physics using the C programming language. There is a short list of introductory-level computational physics books that are written in C. Here is the best, cheapest one:

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Physics-Problem-Solving-Computers/dp/0471115908/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451692823&sr=1-5">Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Computers 1st Edition (by Landau & Paez)</a>

<p>Even better there are <a href="http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~rubin/Books/CPbook/eBook/Lectures/index.html">free video lectures</a> to accompany the text.

<p><b>2. Now that you are used to a C like programming, perhaps this is a good time to think about C++</b>

<p>C++ offers a way of organizing functions called "classes" that C does not offer. There are also some improvements to the way that matricies are initialized in memory.

<p>If you go to google and search for "learn C++" you will be overwhelmed with the choices, many of them good ones to look into.

<p>Our advice is to check out the website for <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~ntg/6810/2014/compphys_2014.php">Physics 6810: Computational Physics at Ohio State University</a>. The first exercise will go into some of the differences between C and C++. Later exercises will go into advanced topics in computational physics.

<p><b>3. Everyone tells me I should learn python and that C programs are lame</b>

<p>You have two choices: (1) you can learn python and see what all the fuss is about, or (2) you can tell them that C programs run just as fast or faster than python programs (which is completely true).

<p>If you choose the first option, then you can either go to <a href="http://codecombat.com">codecombat.com</a> and select python mode, or you can go to the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python">python tutorial for codeacademy.com</a>

<p>When you've finished learning python there are two good computational physics books worth looking at: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3527413154/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0BXNW5HDGTQSF0QVVE9Y&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop">Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Python by Landau et al. (3rd Edition)</a> which includes <a href="http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~rubin/Books/CPbook/eBook/Lectures/index.html">free video lectures</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480145513/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0BXNW5HDGTQSF0QVVE9Y&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop">Computational Physics by Mark Newman</a>

<p>Or you can keep on learning computational physics without learning python (see thought #1 above), which is what a lot of computational physicists did before python became popular. You can always learn it later.
