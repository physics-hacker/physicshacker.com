<H1>Finished everything?</H1>

<p>Did you finish everything? Hungry for more? Here is some thoughts about what to do next:

<p><b>1. If you're interested in processing (the language)</b>

<p>If you're interested to learn more about processing (which is the programming language we use here), we highly recommend Daniel Schiffman's book <a href="http://natureofcode.com">The Nature of Code</a>. The book is freely available in electronic form and the paper version is reasonably priced. We at physicshacker.com have a huge respect for what Daniel Schiffman has done and is doing for the processing community.

<p><b>2. You've just been introduced to computational physics with a programming language that is very similar to C</b>

<p>The simplest thing to do is to continue studying computational physics using the C programming language. There is a short list of introductory-level computational physics books that are written in C. Here is the best, cheapest one:

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Physics-Problem-Solving-Computers/dp/0471115908/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451692823&sr=1-5">Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Computers 1st Edition (by Landau & Paez)</a>

<p>Even better there are <a href="http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~rubin/Books/CPbook/eBook/Lectures/index.html">free video lectures</a> to accompany the text.

<p><b>3. Now that you are used to a C like programming, perhaps this is a good time to think about C++ (object-oriented programming)</b>

<p>C++ offers a way of organizing functions called "classes" that C does not offer (sometimes this is also called object-oriented programming).

<p>If you go to google and search for "learn C++" you will be overwhelmed with the choices.

<p>Our advice is to look through the introduction of Daniel Schiffman's book <a href="http://natureofcode.com">The Nature of Code</a> which describes object-oriented programming and classes and how it is implemented into the processing language. In the exercises we show here we have largely avoided objects and classes for simplicity, but the processing language is perfectly capable of using these features. Even better, the syntax that the processing language uses is very similar, if not the same as used in C++. If you can master the processing language, you will have a much easier time learning C++.

<p>Our advice is to check out the website for <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~ntg/6810/2014/compphys_2014.php">Physics 6810: Computational Physics at Ohio State University</a>. The first exercise will go into some of the differences between C and C++. Later exercises will go into advanced topics in computational physics.

<p><b>4. Everyone tells me I should learn python and that C programs are lame</b>

<p>You have two choices: (1) you can learn python and see what all the fuss is about, or (2) you can tell them that C programs run just as fast or faster than python programs (which is completely true).

<p>If you choose the first option, then you can either go to <a href="http://codecombat.com">codecombat.com</a> and select python mode, or you can go to the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python">python tutorial for codeacademy.com</a>

<p>When you've finished learning python there are two good computational physics books worth looking at: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3527413154/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0BXNW5HDGTQSF0QVVE9Y&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop">Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Python by Landau et al. (3rd Edition)</a> which includes <a href="http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~rubin/Books/CPbook/eBook/Lectures/index.html">free video lectures</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480145513/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0BXNW5HDGTQSF0QVVE9Y&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop">Computational Physics by Mark Newman</a>

<p>Or you can keep on learning computational physics without learning python (see thought #1 above), which is what a lot of computational physicists did before python became popular. You can always learn it later.
