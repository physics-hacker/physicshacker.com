<p>What is a computational physicist?

<p>Answer: A computational physicist is first of all a scientist. Scientists are concerned with discovering new knowledge about the world. A computational physicist is a scientist who specializes in computational physics. That is, a person who specializes in using computers to solve complex problems in physics. Although most of us think of Einstein writing equations out on a chalkboard when we think of physics, <b>most physics problems that researchers encounter are exceedingly difficult or impossible to solve by hand!</b> This being the case, all physicists use computational physics at some point. And some physicist specialize in using computers to solve problems -- these are the computational physicists!

<p>Computational physics is also a kind of computational science. <b>Computational science is totally different than computer science.</b> Computer science research involves developing new programming languages, programming techniques and algorithms for any number of purposes (video streaming, 3D rendering, image processing, word searching, artificial intelligence...). Computational science is about using computers to learn scientific things we didn't know before, especially in complex situations.
