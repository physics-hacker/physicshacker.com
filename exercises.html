<H1>Physics Programming Labs with Processing!!!</H1>

<p>These labs were designed by Dr. Chris Orban and they should be generally useful for advanced high school and introductory college level. No calculus knowledge or prior programming experience is assumed.

<p>These programming labs use a very nice programming framework called <a href="http://processing.org">processing.org</a> which is very similar to C/C++. There is also a convenient way to run these simulations using a web browser called <a href="http://processingjs.org">processing.js</a>

<p>Step 0. If you are *not* using a computer that already has the processing.org
 environment installed, then follow the link below and choose windows 64-bit if 
you are using windows (and make sure to click "Extract" if asked), or Mac OSX if you are using a Mac. 

<p><a href="https://processing.org/download/?processing">Click here to install the processing.org environment if you are using a computer that does not yet have it installed</a>

<p>If you are using a computer that already has the processing.org framework installed please continue:

<p>Physics Programming Labs with Processing Source Code (2016) is a set of codes that accompany Physics Programming Labs with Processing (2016). These codes create interactive physics animations with a simplified syntax. These codes also illustrate the concept of vectors. Physics Programming Labs with Processing Source Code (2016) consists of the *.pde files available on this webpage. The source code is designed to be used with the <a href="http://processing.org">processing.org</a> programming framework.
