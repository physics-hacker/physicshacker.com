<p><b>From Dr. Chris Orban, founder of physicshacker.com:</b>

<p>When I was a kid I was interested in studying physics. Back then the internet was very new and I managed to track down the e-mail address of the Nobel-prize winning physicist Stephen Weinberg. To my enduring surprise he actually responded. His advice to me was to study as much mathematics as I could to prepare for a career in physics. While this isn't neccessarily bad advice, as I look back now as a computational physicist I think even better advice would be to study math and to start learning to program as soon as you can! 

<p>Physicshacker.com is designed to be a set of tutorials that I wish I could go in a time machine and show my adolescant self. Since time machines don't yet exist, the next best thing is to teach people younger than me now.  <b>The <a href="exercises.html">exercises</a> featured here were originally developed for physics classes for freshman engineering majors with no programming experience and no calculus experience</b>. In fact, all the exercises here use a programming language called <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> which is designed to allow absolute beginner programmers to create interesting games and interactive content.

<p>We live in a programmed world. Not only are all our electronic devices and video games programmed, the physics that governs the world itself is iterative. Every moment, nature is calculating the forces acting on every object and the resulting acceleration, which is basically what the <a href="exercises.html">exercises</a> featured here are doing. This is also what is happening behind the scenes in probably every computer animated movie you've ever seen. 

<p>I will close by reiterating the mediocre advice that was given to me as a kid. <b>Never tell a kid that all they need to do to prepare to be a scientist is to study math!</b> Math is great and the more you know the better. But every year I meet college freshman who are at the very top of their math classes and who want to work on a research project with me or one of my colleagues. And no matter how much math they know I ask them "Do you know how to program?" Very rarely do they say yes. Physicshacker.com is my best idea for changing this dynamic.

<p>For people from schools or summer programs who have resources to bring in guest teachers, <a href="invite.html">if you live in Ohio or in California we can potentially send someone out to you for a day-long tutorials on the physicshacker.com exercies</a>. This can be for students or it can be training for teachers. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you are interested in this possibility.

<p>Physicshacker.com is made possible by Dr. Chris Orban with generous help from Zach Schroeder, and other help from Dr. Mandeep Gill, Savva Madar and Jennifer Mankin

<p>Happy hacking!

<p><b>Advice for middle school students:</b>

<p>Study algebra like a boss, and work on sites like <a href="http://code.org">code.org</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">scratch.mit.edu</a> and <a href="http://codecombat.com">codecombat.com</a>. After you complete these you may have an easier time working with the exercises on physicshacker.com
