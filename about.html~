<p><b>From Dr. Chris Orban, founder of physicshacker.com:</b>

<p>When I was a kid I was interested in studying physics. Back then the internet was very new and I managed to track down the e-mail address of the Nobel-prize winning physicist Stephen Weinberg. His advice to me was to study as much mathematics as I could to prepare for a career in physics. While this isn't neccessarily bad advice, as I look back now as a computational physicist I think even better advice would be to study math and to start learning to program as soon as you can! 

<p>Physicshacker.com is designed to be a set of tutorials that I wish I could go in a time machine and show my adolescant self. Since time machines don't yet exist, the next best thing is to teach people younger than me.  The exercises featured here were developed for physics classes for freshman engineering majors with <b>no programming experience and no calculus experience<b>.
