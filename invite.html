<H1>How to invite physicshacker.com to your school!</H1>

<p>We love the internet. We love coding. We love skype and facetime and google hangouts. But there is no substitute for face-to-face, person-to-person interactions, <i>especially</i> when it comes to physics and programming.

<p><b>If you send a request to invite@physicshacker.com someone from physicshacker.com can potentially make a day-long visit to your school and work with students or train teachers to guide students through the physicshacker.com content</b>. For now, we can only visit schools in Ohio and those near the bay area in California. The cost of each visit is flexible, but we would need something like $200 for a day-long visit and a gas card to purchase a tank of gas for the drive there and back. Your school would be visited by a person holding a Ph.D. in physics who is very familiar with the physicshacker.com content. This person will also be properly trained to interact with minors.

<p>We are willing to entertain requests from public high schools, private high schools, summer camps and other entities. Please don't hesitate to contact us if this is of interest to you! We are passionate about teaching high school students to program while teaching them physics. 

<p>Sincerely,
<br>Dr. Chris Orban
<br>Founder of physicshacker.com
