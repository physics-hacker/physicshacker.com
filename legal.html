<H1>Legal Stuff</H1>


<p><H3>Basics:</H3>

<p>Physicshacker.com is led by Dr. Chris Orban, who is also a professor at Ohio State University. The Ohio State University in no way endorses, approves or supports in any way the content on this website, which is hosted from a non-OSU server. The content on this website represents Dr. Chris Orban's "scholarly work" and is owned 100% by him under the Creative Commonts Attribution Non-Commericial 4.0 International License. Dr. Orban is one of relatively few instructors in the country who incorporate programming exercises in introductory college-level physics courses. However, the content here is distinct from the instructional content used in the courses that Dr. Orban teaches at OSU. Students from OSU do not actually use the content on this site in completing their coursework.

<p><b>Educators are free to use this website in their courses as they see fit so long as (1) they credit Dr. Chris Orban as the author of the content, and (2) they comply with the non-commercial restrictions.</b> The latter means that no person or entities can profit from re-distributing the content from this site or from modifying the content on this site (derivative works) and profiting from re-distributing the modified content. In essence, <b>high school and college physics teachers can use the content on this site in their classes for absolutely free and with as many students as desired without notifying any of us that the content is being used and in what contex.</b> Likewise, anyone from the public may use the site to the fullest extent as well. We get a little bit of money from ad revenue from the site, so the more people that use it, the better for us, and if nothing else we get that feeling like we've created something that people have found useful. Please share the website with as many friends and students as you like.

<p><H3>Commercial Entities Beware:</H3>

<p><b><mark>Texbook companies, publishers and other entities cannot under any circumstances profit from the content on physicshacker.com or re-distribute the content without explicit permission!</mark></b> If we discover that some company is doing precisely this we will pursue legal action to the fullest extent as this is clearly forbidden by the non-commercial nature of the creative commons license used here. This includes derivative works. If you think a company has violated our license you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:chris@physicshacker.com">chris@physicshacker.com</a> to alert us.

<p><H3>The Codes:</H3>

<p>The code used on this site is licensed under the GPL v3 license. This means that any modifications/customizations of the code must be shared with us (for example by posting to a publicly-viewable github account and sending us an e-mail). This is like any other community-supported open-source project on the internet and we hope that the required sharing of the code fosters this community in creating introductory computational physics content (which until we started didn't seem to exist at the high school level). If you prefer, you can also post modified code to <a href="http://openprocessing.org">openprocessing.org</a> (or something similar) instead of github.com so long as you use a "physicshacker" tag or otherwise attribute the origin of the code to physicshacker.com.

<p>Use of the code outside of a free exchange of software is explicitly forbiddent by the GPL v3 license (i.e. don't use our code in proprietary software). This means that textbook companies and other entities are forbidden from taking the code from our github account and selling it to consumers or modifying the code and selling it to consumers.

<p>This is great news for anyone interested in contributing or improving the code associated on this website, which is freely available on <a href="http://github.com/physics-hacker/physicshacker.com">github.com/physics-hacker</a>. Any improvements or new codes that you write will be protected from commercial exploitation by the GPL v3 license and you will always be attributed for your contribution. Textbook companies and other entities are explicitly forbidden from profiting from your work. Likewise, physicshacker.com cannot profit from your work because we only make money from ads, merchandise and in-person training sessions/camps. Physicshacker.com does not charge any fees for accessing the codes used on this site and this is unlikely to change.

<p><H3>The Bottom Line:</H3>

<p>There is a very small number of individuals who have banded together to create physicshacker.com and to provide training sessions to schools that reach out to us. None of us are full-time employees. Some of us are motivated to fundamentally change the way that physics is taught. Some of us just want to share the joy of programming. Some of us have kids in our lives and just need a little extra cash to help give them have the same educational opportunities we had growing up. Physicshacker.com is a for-minimal-profit organization with a legal structure that allows us to do everything we're passionate about, and it protects us from everyone who would want to take our ideas and profit from them.
