<p>Physicshacker.com is led by Dr. Chris Orban, who is also a professor at Ohio State University. The Ohio State University in no way endorses, approves or supports in any way the content on this website. The content on this website represents Dr. Orban's "scholarly work" and is owned 100% by him under the Creative Commonts Attribution Non-Commericial 4.0 International License. 

<p>This means that educators are free to use this website in their courses as they see fit so long as (1) they credit Dr. Orban as the author of the content, and (2) they comply with the non-commercial restrictions. The latter means that no person or entities can profit from re-distributing the content from this site or from modifying the content on this site (derivative works) and profiting from that. In essence, high school and college physics teachers can use the content on this site in their classes for absolutely free and with as many students as desired. We get a little bit of money from ad revenue from the site, so please share the site with as many students as possible!

<p>However, texbook companies, publishers and other entities cannot under any circumstances profit from the content on physicshacker.com. If we discover that some company is doing precisely this we will pursue legal action to the fullest extent as this is forbidden by the non-commercial nature of the creative commons license. The only circumstance in which a company would be permitted to profit from the content presented here is if it has explicitly obtained permission from us to do so.

<p>The code used on this site is licensed under the GPL v3 license. This means that any modifications/customizations of the code must be shared with us (for example by posting to a publicly-viewable github account and sending us an e-mail). You can also post modified code to openprocessing.org (or something similar) so long as you use a "physicshacker" tag or otherwise attribute the origin of the code to physicshacker.com.

<p>Use of the code outside of a free exchange of software is explicitly forbiddent by the GPL v3 license (i.e. don't use our code in proprietary software). This means that textbook companies and other entities are forbidden from taking the code from our github account and selling it to consumers or modifying the code and selling it to consumers.

<p>This is great news for anyone interested in contributing or improving the code associated on this website, which is freely available on <a href="http://github.com/physics-hacker/physicshacker.com">github.com/physics-hacker</a>. Any imrpovements or new codes that you submit to use will be protected by the GPL v3 license and you will always be attributed for your contribution. Textbook companies and other entities are explicitly forbidden from profiting from your work. Likewise, physicshacker.com cannot profit from your work because we only make money from ads, merchandise and in-person training sessions/camps. Physicshacker.com does not charge any fees for accessing the codes used on this site and this is unlikely to change.
